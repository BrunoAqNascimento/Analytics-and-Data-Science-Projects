# Bruno Nascimento

*I'm Bruno, I'm a Production Engineer, graduated from the Federal University of Ouro Preto.*

My experience is concentrated in 3 main areas: planning and control of key-performance indicators, efficient and effective process management and execution of continuous improvement projects.

Data analysis has always been part of my routine, and I am increasingly in love with the diverse and efficient methodologies and frameworks that have been emerging. The purpose of this portfolio is to publicize my continuous evolution in Data Science and Analytics. Currently, I am a Project and Business Analytics Analyst at LATAM Airlines.

Everything about analyzing data and scenarios, identifying opportunities for improvement, optimizing processes, increasing performance, delivering solutions that add value and generate solid and sustainable results - is my business core. I am looking to improve my ability to develop data-driven strategies and solutions.


**Background in:** Python,SQL,Data Science,Data Analytics,Lean Six Sigma,Business Intelligence and Operational Research.
